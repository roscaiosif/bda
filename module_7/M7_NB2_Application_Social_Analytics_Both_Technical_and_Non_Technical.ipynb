    "\n",
    "The collection of multi-modal and diverse ranges of signals allows us to better understand network modalities and surface patterns that are difficult to observe or extract from noisy or dirty data. Populations, and the patterns they exhibit, are complex by definition, and there is no single one-size-fits-all method to approach the different studies. You would typically start your study with physical sensors, before extending your data set with social and other data to better understand the community or group being studied. In many cases, it is difficult to motivate for large-scale data collection processes to be initiated, but data generated for other purposes can be reused to build and extend analyses. Data from the telecommunications industry is a rich source of insight into human behavior and has been found to be useful in a wide range of topics across multiple fields. This notebook briefly looks at some of these use cases. Using data generated as output of other processes introduces risks (such as changes in the processes that generate the data), but offers the ability to perform analyses that were not previously possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The application of many of the concepts in this course is non-trivial and very specific to the use case at hand. You can refer to [this](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/08/22/1602803113.full) article, which describes a theoretical framework, to better understand the fundamental structures of dynamic social networks.\n"

    "In his explanation of how big data may be applied in Human Resources (HR), Arek Stopczynski discusses sociometric badges, face-to-face contact, and privacy considerations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Big data studies that have appropriate interventions can play a significant role in ensuring a more effective, productive, and happy workforce. These studies are typically very sensitive to privacy considerations due to the short time frame between observation and potential impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 Privacy\n",
    "In Video 2, Arek also asks whether or not you care (or should care) if a random company knows where you are at any given point in time, (for example, a free application on your cellphone requiring location data) and whether your feelings would change if it was the company you work for that knows where you are. Many applications where you share your data can also be used to gain insights into aspects of your life that you may not be comfortable sharing with your employer. This is because some of these insights can be taken out of context resulting in privacy violations and subsequent loss of trust. Consider [Pokemon Go](https://www.reffind.com/pokemon-go-says-employees/) as an application that can potentially be used to gain insights about you.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2 Trust\n",
    "A recent talk by one of Gartner’s analysts, Frank Buytendijk, stated that trust is an emotion. He said, “It is the confidence people have in your future behavior” (Gartner 2015). He then went on to say that “algorithms allow companies to trust people to the exact level they deserve: dynamically and at scale. Trust goes two ways. People must trust your business too, to connect to you. It is the confidence people have in your future behavior” (Gartner 2015).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more about the topic on Page 11 of [this](http://gartnerinfo.com/sym25/rising_to_the_challenge_of_d_290064.pdf) Gartner report.\n",

    "**The five key dynamics to trust are**:\n",
    "* Structure and clarity;\n",
    "* Psychological safety;\n",
    "* Dependability;\n",
    "* Meaning; and\n",
    "* Impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those who are interested in exploring additional material on trust can review the following two articles:\n",
    "1. [Out of sight, short of trust](http://www.academia.edu/2887790/Out_of_sight_short_of_trust._Elena_Rocco_Thomas_A._Finholt_and_Erik_C._Hofer_Collaboratory_for_Research_on_Electronic_Work_School_of_Information_University_of_Michigan)\n",

    "\n",
    "Once you are in a trusted relationship with employees, you can start to analyze interesting questions such as “do teams have intelligence?”.\n",
    "\n",
    "This question has been answered by [Anita Woolley et al.](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/330/6004/686.full) (2010), and was covered by Arek Stopczynski in Video 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding trust and the interactions in networks allow us to make optimal use of available technologies, structures, and teams; and to build more effective and productive virtual teams. Before considering the potential interventions that you can apply in your particular industry, you can review the article “[Getting Virtual Teams Right](https://hbr.org/2014/12/getting-virtual-teams-right)” for more information on this topic."
